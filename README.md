Before you run the script, install Docker: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/   
We need docker because our script utilizes a selenium bot to crawl data, which mimicks human interaction to avoid bot detection.  
You can hit CTRL-C to terminate script anytime.  
Occasionally, the script might crash. Simply run it again and it most likely would work the next time.
